# ðŸ¦  Clustering of COVID-19 Patient Locations using K-Means

## Project Description
This project applies the K-Means clustering algorithm to group COVID-19 patient location data based on spatial proximity. Using the known coordinates of infected individuals, the natural groupings or clusters that could represent localized outbreak zones or transmission paths were identified.

The algorithm is implemented from scratch in Python using vectorized operations with NumPy, enhanced by k-means++ initialization for better accuracy and convergence, and visualized using matplotlib. The clustering quality is also evaluated using the Silhouette Score from scikit-learn.

It demonstrates the power of unsupervised machine learning in deriving insight from unlabeled, real-world data.

## Problem Statement:
During the outbreak of viruses such as COVID-19, understanding how infections spread spatially is critical. Given only the coordinates of infected individuals, including 4 known initially infected patients, can we:

- Group other patients based on proximity to these initial cases?

- Identify which geographic regions are likely hotspots or cluster zones?

The assumption is that these infections were due to proximity or based on locaton similarity. Factors such as travel methods (car, plane, train etc.), temporal progression (when they got infected), infection chains or contact tracing, and individual behavior (mobility, superspreaders) were not considered in the absence of movement history nor time-based spread.

## Other Applications
Adaptations of this solution can be used in various applications such as:
- Image segmentation: Segmenting images based on color or texture features.
- Customer segmentation: Grouping customers based on purchasing habits or demographic data.
- Anomaly detection: Identifying outliers in datasets.
- Document clustering: Grouping similar documents based on content.
- Recommender systems: Recommending products or services based on user preferences


## Input Format (kmeans.txt):
50              # Max number of iterations

100             # Number of total patients

4               # Number of clusters (number of known initial infections)

12              # Index of centroid 1 (known initial infection source)

23              # Index of centroid 2 (known initial infection source)

50              # Index of centroid 3 (known initial infection source)

67              # Index of centroid 4 (known initial infection source)

83,13           # Patient 1 (x, y)

...

81,32           # Patient 100

## Outputs:
- Initial and final centroid coordinates

- Number of patients in each cluster

- Iterations to convergence

- Cluster visual plot

- Silhouette Score (clustering performance metric)


## Extensions:
- Incorporate time-stamped location data to track spread over time

- Use density-based clustering (e.g. DBSCAN) for comparison

- Deploy the model as an interactive web app
